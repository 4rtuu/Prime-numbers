// 1. project starts at main method line 97
// 2. the main method starts out by setting bool whileTrue variable/parameter to "true"
// 3. a while loop is initiated with signature of parameter whileTrue as "true" (basically making an infinite loop)
// 4. in this loop a console class method WriteLine is initiated with output "Please provide a number:"
//      eg. console prints out the message
// 5. afterwards an if statement is in place to check whether a user provided input is convertable to integer
//      Console.ReadLine returns a string but any string is convertable to int if it contains only numbers with no other symbols
//      in other case conversion would fail and:

// 6. if statement signature is false/failed and thus starts doing all the embedded stuff within
// 7. writes both messages "Your input is not a valid number." and "Press any key to exit."
// 8. expects an input of any key to terminate the app
// 9. meanwhile sets the bool whileTrue parameter to "false"
//      this bool parameter as "false" will stop the loop because it does not meet the criteria of being "true"
//      any if statement or loop with a value of boolean with expect value of "true" by default
//      alternatively it is possible to declare it manually eg. whileTrue == false or whileTrue == true
//      eg. while(whileTrue == false) {} the loop will only work if the bool parameter is "false"
//      at the moment of initialization
// 10. and breaks out of the loop or in this case just freezes and expects user input to close the app

// 6. if statement signature is true/passed the statement embedded stuff is skipped
// 7. the method IteratePrimes is initiated with its signature of "max"
//      where "max" is expected as int primitive type see line 27 methods IteratePrimes signature
//      and in this case the "max" variable is passed as returned output as integer of user inserted input string, see 5. as reference
//                  IteratePrimes(int arg) initialization
// 8. first off this method on initialization writes a new empty line in console for aesthetics
// 9. now the logic starts, a loop is initiated with a signature of "max" loops to expect is the provided integer number that
//      you can find in the IteratePrimes(int argument) method itself as passed value that the method is working with
//      and a new variable "num" is asigned of integer of 2 and each loop would increment the 2 by one, hence the last part of the
//      signature "num++"
//      Increment & Decrement Explenation
//      ðŸ”— https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-c-30/9780596155018/ch04s04.html
//      for the sake of logic the "num" argument is assigned 2 instead of any other number
//      is because the prime numbers are as following example. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23 and 29.
//      therefore number 1 is not neccessary and is skipped.
//      so now the loop is going to incement the number 2 by one each time, so by the end of a loop and by starting once again
//      the "num" instead of being assigned the value of 2 once more, it will increment it thus fulfilling only
//      the two other parts of the signature, checking wether the "num" argument is smaller or equal to argument "max" and if true
//      will be incremented +1 thus 2 will result in 3 and the next loop it will be 4
//      and considering that "max" arg is eg. 5 then if the "num" arg reaches the value of 5 it will stop the loop and continue on
//      anything right after the for loop
// 10. thus the first thing that happens during this looping a new argument(variable/parameter - technically an argument
//      is a signature value that is being expected (eg. line 27), parameter is a global class variable and variable is a local
//      method variable (eg. line 100) having a value assigned to it on the spot while executing the ongoing logic)
//      is being assigned.
//      this boolean variable "check" of assigned value "true" is to later on to define that job is done, eg being assigned
//      the value of "false"
// 11. then another loop is being initiated of int var of value 2 (line 167 for explenation on why number 2)
//      this loop has a bit of more sophisticated logic to its signature
//      the num arg, taken from the outer loop, is being divided by 2 this is for optimisation reasons,
//      so that hardware does not keep random uneccessary values into memorey (ignore this for now)
// 12. an if statement is being passed with a signature of "num % i == 0"
//      this basically checks if arg "num" modulo arg "i" is equal to "0"
//      if the value is zero that means that the number is not odd and thus is not a prime number
//      this is extremely specific scenario and in this case "num % i == 0" would always return false if the result is greater than
//      or lesser than 0
//      this results into break operation (line 70 for explenation onto break and continue)
//      and the loop operation is instantly broken and thus the code runs on continueing the outter loop
//      IF "num" modulo "i" not 0 and that would mean that the value is odd, what we need...
//      the outter loop provides anothe if statement expecting "check == true && num != 4"
//      Soo if arg "check" is equal to to true AND arg "num" is not equal to number 4
//          the number four check is because I'm lazy and the algorithm threw out number 4 as prime number and this
//          would count as a quick and dirty fix
//      By passing the if statement a console.writeline method is initiated and the correct prime number is being printed out
